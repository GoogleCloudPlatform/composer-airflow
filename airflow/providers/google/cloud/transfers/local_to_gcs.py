    :param src: Path to the local file, or list of local files. Path can be either absolute
        (e.g. /path/to/file.ext) or relative (e.g. ../../foo/*/*.csv). (templated)
    :param dst: Destination path within the specified bucket on GCS (e.g. /path/to/file.ext).
        If multiple files are being uploaded, specify object prefix with trailing backslash
        (e.g. /path/to/directory/) (templated)
    :param bucket: The bucket to upload to. (templated)
    :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
    :param mime_type: The mime-type string
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate, if any
    :param gzip: Allows for file to be compressed and uploaded as gzip
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
