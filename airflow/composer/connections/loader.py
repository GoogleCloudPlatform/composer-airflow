"""Module that loads Airflow connection assets required for Composer 1.*.* versions.

For Composer 1.*.* versions we prepare connection assets populated from all available providers.
This is a temporary workaround of not being able to install customer pypi packages to
Airflow UI docker image and therefore extend connection types, details here b/189095667.

See usage in ProvidersManager.
