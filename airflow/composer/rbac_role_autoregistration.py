"""Airflow RBAC per-folder role autoregistration.

This cluster policy is enabled only when both [webserver]rbac and
[webserver]rbac_autoregister_per_folder_roles configuration properties are True.
It runs for every DAG processed by Airflow scheduler, and implements per-folder
role autoregistration in Airflow RBAC, which works in the following way:

    * If the DAG is located in a subfolder of the DAGs folder, and the subfolder
      name can be used as Airflow RBAC role name, then:

        * Use the subfolder name as the role name.
        * Create the role in Airflow RBAC if it doesn't exist yet.
        * Add can_dag_edit and can_dag_read permissions on the DAG to the role.

The policy runs in scheduler's DAG file processing subprocesses, and uses shared
objects from the main scheduler process.
