class DateTimeSensor(BaseSensorOperator):
    """
    Waits until the specified datetime.

    A major advantage of this sensor is idempotence for the ``target_time``.
    It handles some cases for which ``TimeSensor`` and ``TimeDeltaSensor`` are not suited.

    **Example** 1 :
        If a task needs to wait for 11am on each ``execution_date``. Using
        ``TimeSensor`` or ``TimeDeltaSensor``, all backfill tasks started at
        1am have to wait for 10 hours. This is unnecessary, e.g. a backfill
        task with ``{{ ds }} = '1970-01-01'`` does not need to wait because
        ``1970-01-01T11:00:00`` has already passed.

    **Example** 2 :
        If a DAG is scheduled to run at 23:00 daily, but one of the tasks is
        required to run at 01:00 next day, using ``TimeSensor`` will return
        ``True`` immediately because 23:00 > 01:00. Instead, we can do this:

        .. code-block:: python

            DateTimeSensor(
                task_id='wait_for_0100',
                target_time='{{ next_execution_date.tomorrow().replace(hour=1) }}',
            )

    :param target_time: datetime after which the job succeeds. (templated)
    :type target_time: str or datetime.datetime
